# BajaDAS: Data Acquisition System for Highlander Racing test

BajaDAS is a data acquisition system tailored for the Highlander Racing team's vehicles. It gathers real-time telemetry data, crucial for performance analytics and diagnostics.

## Quick Start

Note: PlatformIO is required for this project.

1. Open the project files in PlatformIO.
2. Insert a formatted MicroSD card into the BajaDAS system.
3. Use the `PlatformIO: Upload` button to load the code onto the microcontroller.
4. Use a Serial Monitor at a `115200` baud rate to view data.
5. Post-race, retrieve the SD card and access the `.csv` files for analysis.
